The content of each cell is initially hidden. 
There are M mines hidden in M different cells of the grid. 
No other cells contain mines. 
You may click on any cell to reveal it. 
If the revealed cell contains a mine, then the game is over, and you lose. 
Otherwise, the revealed cell will contain a digit, inclusive, 
which corresponds to the number of neighboring cells that contain mines.
Two cells are neighbors if they share a corner or an edge. 
Additionally, if the revealed cell contains a 0, 
then all of the neighbors of the revealed cell are automatically 
revealed as well, recursively. When all the cells that don't contain 
mines have been revealed, the game ends, and you win.
